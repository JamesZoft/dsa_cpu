DSA Coursework 1 assessed parts

All of the relevant parts of my coursework follow on as pages of pdf after this cover page. I wasn't sure which output you wanted (with the changed input or not) so I included both and have labelled them as such.

My assembler and disassembler are at github.com/jarob22/dsa_cw1_assembler_disassembler
