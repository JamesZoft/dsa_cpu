\section{Overview}
My decoded and commented hex is in decoded_commented_hex.txt, with my unlocking code in a separate text file in this folder. My assembler and disassembler are in the .zip with instructions on how to run them if you wish. My reports are in the reports/ directory as directed and my unlocking code, decoded hex and assembler/disassembler are in the extra/ folder.
