\section{Overview}
My decoded and commented hex is in decoded\_commented\_hex.txt, with my unlocking code in a separate text file in this folder. My assembler and disassembler are in the .zip with instructions on how to run them if you wish. My reports are in the reports/ directory as directed and my unlocking code, decoded hex and assembler/disassembler are in the extra/ folder.

With regards to the conversation we had about the difference in clock speeds between mine and Oliver's solutions, Oliver has 100 more flipflops in his execution unit resource utilisation and only a few more multipliers, though overall resource usage seems to be about the same for both of us. Therefore, the only way mine was the 7MHz faster could be that my delay paths were a lot shorter than his, due to the modularity in his design, which although did make for a slower design, meant that his is a lot easier to extend and maintain.

With this final design, about three cores can be fit onto the FPGA, although this is not synthesised for resource efficiency, but for speed. My youtube video to provide proof of the design working is available at: http://youtu.be/Djtp4h828_A
